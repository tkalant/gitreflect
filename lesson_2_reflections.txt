What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init (in the directory you wish to create the git repository in)
git status

You create a git repository within a directory.
Now you can start adding files from your directory to the git repository.
Once files are added to git, you can start committing changes to them, and keep track of the changes in your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
You add files FROM working direcotory to the staging area, before you commit them to the git repository.
Kinda like an intermediate env before you finish working with them.
Possible advantage: Keep a temp version of file in case you forget to commit
or your computer shuts down or whatever?
